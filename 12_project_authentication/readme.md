# There are several ways to build an authentication system

🔐 1. Session-Based Authentication (Traditional Login)
Concept: When a user logs in, the server creates a session and stores it in memory or a database. The session ID is sent to the client via cookies.
Tech: Express sessions, PHP sessions, Django sessions.
Use case: Good for server-rendered web apps (like e-commerce, admin panels).

🔐 2. Token-Based Authentication (Stateless)
Concept: The server issues a token (usually JWT) after login. The client includes it in the headers (usually Authorization) in every request.
Tech: JWT (JSON Web Tokens), Bearer tokens, Passport.js strategies.
Use case: REST APIs, mobile apps, SPA (Single Page Apps) like React, Vue.

🔄 3. Token-Based Authentication with Refresh Tokens
Concept:
Access Token = short-lived
Refresh Token = long-lived (used to get new access tokens)
Security: More secure, avoids re-login, handles expiry smartly.
Tech: JWT, Redis (for storing refresh tokens), cookies or HTTP-only cookies.
Use case: Scalable modern applications, especially SPAs and mobile apps.

☁️ 4. OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect (Third-Party Auth)
Concept: Let users log in with Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.
Tech: OAuth2, OIDC, Auth0, Firebase Auth, NextAuth.js.
Use case: Social login or enterprise SSO (Single Sign-On).

🔐 5. Biometric Authentication
Concept: FaceID, fingerprint scanning, etc.
Tech: WebAuthn, FIDO2, device APIs (on mobile).
Use case: Native apps, progressive web apps (PWAs).

🧠 6. Passwordless Authentication
Concept: No password at all. Login with:
Magic link (sent via email)
One-Time Password (OTP) via email/SMS
Tech: Auth0, Firebase, Magic.link
Use case: Simpler user experience, reduces risk from password hacks.

🧩 7. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Concept: Combine two or more factors:
Something you know (password)
Something you have (OTP, device)
Something you are (biometrics)
Tech: Google Authenticator, Twilio Verify, TOTP, WebAuthn.
Use case: Security-focused apps like banking, admin panels.

🚀 Modern Tech Stack Example (for your learning goal)
Node.js + Express + JWT + Refresh Token + MongoDB/Redis + bcrypt + middleware for auth

💻 Web App Authentication Stacks
